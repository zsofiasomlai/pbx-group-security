Chose one of the these transcribed texts (from audio file) :

 -  [Elon Musk is a programmer](https://github.com/project-cx/pbx-group-security/blob/master/content/blog/drafts/dinis/_transcribed/elon-musk-is-a-programmer.md)
 -  [Don't give others your problems](https://github.com/project-cx/pbx-group-security/blob/master/content/blog/drafts/dinis/_transcribed/dont-give-others-your-problems.md)
 -  [Dream Head of Risk and Compliance](https://github.com/project-cx/pbx-group-security/blob/10a36830cace307947012e61e205246800c50c1c/content/blog/drafts/dinis/_transcribed/deam-head-of-risk-and-compliance.md)

As you can see, the key content is there, but the text is in a very casual and informal tone.

Your task is to convert this text into an professionally written blog post, which is good enough to be posted (for example) at https://pbx-group-security.com/blog/

Fell free to ask questions (as an [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/project-cx/pbx-group-security/issues)) and to
take creative/technical liberty with the text (to make it better)

This is an example of the kind of tasks that we would like you to help us with.
