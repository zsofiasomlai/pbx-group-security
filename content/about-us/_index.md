#### Who we are and what do we do
Photobox Group Security is the team responsible for securing magic moments for customers of our brands.

On this site we will aim to showcase why the Photobox Group is a great place to work, feature our latest thinking on the blog as well as post the current openings. So if we’ve managed to convince you, take a look at the challenges and get in touch!  


#### Our Way of Working 
It takes a particular kind of spirit to work in the PhotoBox Group. It’s not for everyone. For a start, we’re a place for self starters and free thinkers. We thrive on each other’s passion for delivering amazing customer experiences, never standing still and constantly challenging the status quo. We look for new and better ways to consistently deliver results and wow customers.

We can be chaotic in our methods and while this is something we’re getting better at, the reality is when you join us, you won’t necessarily have clear structures and processes to guide you. We need people who can carve their own path and even work with others to show us the way. If you see this as the freedom to fly, read on. 

What you will get from us is a whole heap of people who want to help you succeed. People who are passionate about seeing our business thrive. People who want to share what they know and what they’ve learned with you. You’ll get the chance to work on projects that are changing the experience for customers and colleagues, and everyone is welcome. 

We’re at an exciting time in our evolution. We’re growing up but not growing old. We want people who can take us to the next level. People who have been there and done that, but who are up for doing things differently as well. In return we’ll invest all we can in making sure you get the best from our family of brands, because we do everything. This is a place where you can get your teeth into doing business differently. And enjoy it. Business might be serious, but we don’t have to take ourselves too seriously.

#### Our Values 
We believe in each other: anything is possible here because we value and support each other. We do our best work when everyone has a voice and we create an environment where we can fail fast and learn quickly. 
We shake things up: looking for new ways to deliver exceptional products and services to our customers. We challenge the status quo and each other - creating, exploring, learning, growing.
We win together: by building relationships, collaborating and tapping into the imagination and expertise of everyone, across our family of brands, we create amazing experiences.
We make magic happen: we go all-out to create moments that wow, surprise and warm the hearts of our customers and each other. This is our business.
