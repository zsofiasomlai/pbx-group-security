## Photobox around the globe

Photobox is one of many companies for whom the sun never sets. Our work force is contributing to our products and our brand from
Singapore, South Africa, Canada, and Europe.

## Working together, apart
There are many asynchronous tasks that are easily met by a team composed of members working at a distance from each other. 
Even big projects can be broken down into modules and completed by groups in different locations. Many companies have attempted to create
Global Virtual Teams, failure, however, is common. Often when disparate teams attempt to solve complex problems using modern communication technologies the people involved give up, 
because they fail to communicate well with each other. Typically the work process is reorganized to reduce the need for distant 
communication.

## Working together well whilst apart

We are determined not to fail, and so we follow some [simple guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intman.2017.05.001). Apply these and your team will succeed in 
communicating across the world’s divide:

- Encourage networking in real life, or using Audio Visual. If you want teams to work together then ensure that they meet each other. 
Experiments in shared investment trading found that people behaved collaboratively if they had briefly met, or seen their collaborator, 
yet selfishly if they had only used a chat system like Slack.

- Don’t ask for meetings to solve complex issues using team members in very different time zones.
There needs to be a synchronicity of experience between people. A big part of that is our circadian rhythm. Having all your people 
with breakfast inside, but not hungry for lunch yet, (or tired and thinking about the commute back home) allows more of the team to 
be working at the same tick-over rate, with similar mental states. There are limits to how far apart metabolically and rhythmically 
people can be, to achieve certain highly-coupled tasks.

- If any meeting members are communicating in a second language audio-visual (AV) must be used. If everyone speaks the same language you
may skip the visual unless you are discussing common designs, files, shared experiences in which case; visual is back in the useful column.
AV has to be the technology that people still fail at the most. It is not uncommon, even now, for half of an hour-long meeting to be 
taken up with getting everyone present and accounted for. File sharing and desktop sharing has become a smooth experience with apps 
such as Hangouts and TeamViewer in the field. 

Getting to see a person with their face close enough and expressive enough, with the 
microphone well set, is essential to effective communication. This has to be addressed by us folks behaving a whole lot smarter. 
If the team does not know each other, then a person should say their own name, every time they jump in with a comment. For team meetings 
between offices, with many people in one room, there needs to be a hot seat or a hot space- where someone 
talking for more than 10 words must take the stand so that their gestures and expressions are clear to the recipients. 
Even more challenging, that person holding court needs to see the expressions of the recipients who understand them the least, 
to fine tune their words in response.


## Analyse your work-flows

Many technologies exist to enable collaboration. Teams can choose a simple editing flow or a parallel editing flow, which is most effective for your team? 
Check your flow for bottlenecks, have you created a [centrally managed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starfish_and_the_Spider), despite your best intentions? 
Git Hub and Wiki-style tech is great for collaborative, logic-based tasks. Whereas, more real-time interaction, such as Slack and Hangouts suits 
creative problem-solving tasks.

## Analyse your team

Different teams excel at different tasks. Studies have revealed that diverse groups of people are better at creating diverse and 
novel solutions to problems, whilst teams that share a cultural and social background are better at implementation.

So get on hangouts, go and meet all your team members because we are people after all, not machines.
