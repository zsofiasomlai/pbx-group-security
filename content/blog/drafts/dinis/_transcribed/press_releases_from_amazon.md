Press Releases for Project Briefs
 
At PhotoBox Group Security, we are trying to adopt the Amazon press release model; which is a really interesting way to map projects. Traditionally, this is applied to bigger projects, and we have already used this internally for a couple. What we aim to do, in our team, is to use it across the board for much smaller projects. The key element that I like about the press release concept is the front page containing all the key information, which is then followed by a queue of FAQs. FAQs are interesting because they provide a lot of flexibility; they allow you to target specific audiences, or specific areas that you want to cover, or even specific aspects of the projects. FAQs can evolve as the project goes: from the planning phase, to execution, to completion. We will use Jira to store all this data, providing version control. 

The key to this, becomes what I call the "press release", or front page. It provides the vision, where you can say, "this is what success looks like". It is, or course, vital to consider the audience. Is this a press release for an internal team, or for customers?
Because there is also some interesting sense of brevities. 
When you get this right, this can be really powerful. It also scales well, a press release for a very small project may provide one or two paragraphs, or you can have five. This allows the project management team running the project to make joining a project, or contributing to a project really easy. Stakeholders can be given instant access to: disparate sources of information and help; "how tos"; examples and templates. 

This change will involve a teething process, and the project team may need assistance for the first five or ten versions of this. Once they are familiar with the process, implementing this for the next projects will be easier, because they already have a good set of examples. 

The recommendation for getting started is to take a several projects, that are already running. 
Recall the philosophy that everything that everybody is doing, is a project? 
Every project has: a budget, a team, resources, and information. 
So, we are ready to on-board those projects that already exist, allowing us to go very quickly to the meat of the matter, which is writing those press releases in a way that they get consumed. 
The challenge to the team is to represent the reality of the situation. They don't have to worry: "is this going to be approved"?; "is it not going to be approved?" Because, by definition, those initial set up projects, they are already approved, the resources are already allocated.

The first major milestone is to reach a point of balance, where we have press releases created in a realistic, workable and usable way; representing every single current project. Yes, this number will be large, because there is a lot going on, however, this is a vital component to managing all this.

We are sensitive to ensuring that the project management team doesn't overload the other teams implementing this, which means that they have to find solutions to simplify the exercise. One strategy is to interview the teams, to ask them to describe what they do. Then the project management team can take that, create a press release, map it out, and ask: "did we capture everything?" It is simple to get buy in when you start by asking: "what are you doing?", "how does it work?". After that the project team can just observe, if buy in does not progress they can sit with the team and say: "what are you doing?". They observe, and then, reverse engineer the press release and the FAQ, based on what is actually happening at that moment.

The good news is that you don't have to invent too much. There is no heavy approval process, implementation is underway. We will know that we have reached the first milestone, when anyone can correctly describe all the current projects within the Photobox Group Security team, based on the press releases for all the projects. Then, in review meetings, where you sit down with all the stakeholders including the key persons that are accountable, and the exec levels we can access and review everything with ease. Rather than raising actionables in such meetings asking for further information we can answer all questions, address all queries, and then you can just run with it.

So, that's the philosophy behind our implementation of the press release concept from Amazon, which is a really cool idea.
