  - Line 20 first sentence - requires clarifying. 
   - Is the line talkin of using this recruitment process as a way to test run using graphs/nodes in such a way?

Creating a Neo4J graph for the recruitment process

Any recruitment process can be visualised as a giant graph: the requests for hires and positions to be filled; the skills that we need; the potential candidates and the interactions that we have with them; and their inter-connections with members of the team or within the wider community.

The beauty of the graph is that you can evolve the process and the workflow. The design and flow of the process can iteratively evolve the more you understand the implications and the more data you collect. Eventually this reaches a stable state, where you have a process that works efficiently, captures the information you need, and can easily be modified to add new relationships and gives feedback on what actually is going on.

A good workflow graph can help drive behavior, and it's much easier to scale.

As a way to get started, we can challenge the candidates to create an example of a simple recruitment process and how they could visualise the process in Neo4J, a graphing database. The goal would be to store, capture and visualize the data and relationships from the process. In Neo4J, for example, the properties of the base graph could be to make the candidates and skills into nodes, and our relationship and the connections between them as edges.

So, can we use our current recruitment process as a way to visualize this process? Can we use graphs in the recruitment process as a way to make it much more efficient and much more effective? We want to create a great experience for the candidates and make the process efficient so we can find the right candidates and capture data on the process. The problem today is that it's already a really complex data set, and if we don't figure this out, we will be swamped. We want to answer basic questions -- such as when to reply to candidates, templates for replies, how to put pressure following an offer, and how to set a value to each of the candidates.

With a graph, I'm hoping we can create a really powerful workflow.
