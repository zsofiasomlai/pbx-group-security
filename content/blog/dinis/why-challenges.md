## How does it work?

The flow is simple and, if you want it to be, fast. Apply for the [post](https://pbx-group-security.com/roles/) and complete the challenges that we set you. Impress us with those and we will invite you to an OWASP working session, where we get to meet you face to face. If we work well together you will be invited to a formal interview. 

## Why challenges?

Why are we asking applicants to take up the various challenges and provide all this extra information before we even meet?

Our challenges will highlight the opportunities and advantages of working with Photobox Security Group. They represent what we do on a daily basis, and give you a feel for the job you will do. We want to avoid the horror stories from other corporations, who use irrelevant challenges that focus on knotty intellectual, problem-solving capabilities that are worlds away from the realities of the job being advertised.

This process allows us to learn what other people have done and how our own recruitment process can improve. In Photobox Group Security we believe in openness, and this open discussion of our recruitment process is an example of that culture in action. 

CVs aren't always a good reflection of a person's capabilities. They can be exaggerated, they don't always show a person's true potential and can make it hard for recruiters to make a fair assessment. We view these challenges as a fair way for you to demonstrate your skills and experience.

Interviews should provide the opportunity to discuss a project of which everyone has some experience. This is where the challenges come in. When a candidate excels at particular challenges we have something tangible to discuss during the interview; their thoughts and reactions to the challenges.

## Show us how you shine
The challenges will allow you to shine. Some candidates react very quickly under pressure, while others take time to reflect and do some research. We aren't necessarily looking for someone who has all the answers straight away, but for someone who is driven to find the answers. If you need more time, even a couple of days, as long as the quality of your output is excellent then you're the person we're looking for. 

## Have fun
The challenges should be fun; you should enjoy them, as well as learn from them. Even if you don't make it to the end of the selection process, hopefully the challenges will allow you to explore the gaps in your skill set and illustrate why this job may not be the right one for you, at this moment in time.
